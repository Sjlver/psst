## Where and How to Store Shares?

How to store shares is up to you, the user! It is a complex question for which
we provide only minimal guidance here. The main recommendation is to store
shares in different physical locations; otherwise, there is again a single point
of failure, and not much is gained by using `psst`.

An important consideration is whether to give shares to other people, or to
store them in locations that only you have access to. By involving other people,
you can potentially increase the availability of shares. You can give
instructions for what to do with shares in emergencies or when you die.

That said, involving other people also puts trust and responsability on them. It
might put people at risk. In extreme cases, they might get robbed or kidnapped
by people who want to obtain the secret share. Please follow `psst`s principle
to only include people who have fun participating.
